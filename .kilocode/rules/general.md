# Commit Message Generation

Generate a Conventional Commits compliant commit message. The commit message must start
with a <type> followed by a colon and a space, then a <summary>. The <type> must be one of
feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, perf, test, or chore. The <summary> must be a concise,
imperative statement of 72 characters or less. Do not include any additional text,
explanations, or formatting. Provide only the final commit message.
